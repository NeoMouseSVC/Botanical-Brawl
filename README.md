# Botanical-Brawl
Second game project for ITCS-4230

## Description
Botanical Brawl is a business simulator with strategic business-making and gardening with intense waves of enemies wanting to ruin your garden. You are a botanist who has opened up their very own plant store, so try your best to keep your business afloat while defending yourself from hordes of insect zombies trying to eat your plants. Plant and grow various plants, some with unique combat abilities, from explosive dragon fruit to sticky potatoes. Repel waves of zombie insects attempting to breach your garden walls. Upgrade your plants with points acquired by defeating zombies!

## Instructions
### Day Cycle - Tycoon (Shop/Garden)
When you press start you spawn in the garden watching your plants grow. 
If you transition to the shop you can put the crops you grew to sell for revenue.
To plant crops in the shop you have to hit "P" which will then put you in the planting state (you will know you can plant by the fact that a crop will follow your mouse cursor).
In the shop you will see some pots and when in plant mode you will only be able to plant in the pots.
There are various plants, and you can switch plant types using your mouse scroll wheel.
